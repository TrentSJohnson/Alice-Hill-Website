You were the wild child. At the Science Hill Female Academy, the teachers were always rapping your knuckles with rulers and making you clap the chalk board erasers after class. However, you find an outlet though Shakespeare. The wild and imaginative tales take you far away from the sleepy town.

Through your antics, you met William Hill. He was one of the few people who enjoyed all of your adventures. When your parents told you it was time to marry, he was pretty much the only option.
