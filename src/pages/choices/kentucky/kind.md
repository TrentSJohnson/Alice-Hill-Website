You were the kind child. You were always helping with chores and listening carefully to your parents instructions. <span class="bold">At the Science Hill Female Academy</span>, you were always helping out the younger students and was extremely popular with students and teachers alike. Furthermore, you developed a deep love for literature, especially Shakespeare. The elegant tales with acts of romancea and selfless acts appeal to you.

When your parents told you it was time to marry, you listened and picked out William Hill from your parents small list of approved bachelors. He was nice, but you mostly married him to make your parents happy.
