A Friend's Counsel
Alice Polk Hill

Thy heart, my friend, is sad to-night. 
But do not wish the sorrow gone; 

Though deep thy grief to human sight, 
'Tis measured to thee from the Throne. 

Despondingly thou shouldn’t not yield; 

The birds of heaven in their flight 
And e'en the lilies of the field 

In God's protecting love delight. 

Then calm thy heart, let conflicts cease. 

In joy and grief alike there lies 
A lesson, which, in hours of peace. 

Will prove a training for the skies. 

Art mourning now a broken spell? 

Thy heart's young morning turned to night? 
All earth will change— Ah, then 'tis well 

To pray, and save thy soul from blight 

Perhaps thy love is with the dead, 
A living thought have I for thee, 

Which o'er thy path a light will shed— 
'Tis this: All things that were will be. 

Is there a dark weight on thy soul, 
Some fault that pains, or secret sin? 

A sacrifice there is. Control 

The tempest raging high within. 

The web of life, with colors rare, 
Designed for thee by hand divine, 

Shows beauty in the pattern where 
The sombre with the bright combine. 

Some day you'll see the web complete, 
When all this shade, so dark, will be 

Most prized; and then, in chorus sweet. 
You'll sing: "The Father loveth me."
