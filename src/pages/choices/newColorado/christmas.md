Its Christmas Eve, you and your husband sit by the fire as the winds howl around your home. This is your first Christmas away from home and you long to return to the warmer weathers of Kentucky. Despite this, Christmas is a time of celebration of God and Jesus. You pull out a pen and write a poem to match what you are feeling.
