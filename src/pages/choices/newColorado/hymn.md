Christmas Hymn 
Alice Polk Hill

The angel voices of the sky 

Which on that holy night 
Sang, "Glory be to God on High"â€” 

Still sing of joy and light. 

That light, whose clear and shining beam 
Illum'ed the shepherd boy 
And led to him whose love supreme 
Supplants all fear with joy. 

Oh, light divine, be ever near; 

Let not thy rays grow dim. 
Till we, like shepherds, without fear. 

Through faith are led to him.
