Time sweeps the stories and lives of almost every person who walked this Earth. A few are still famous, more are ancestors whose stories are told to grandchildren, but almost all are lost. Some noble people take it up upon themselves to help preserve these stories. Alice Polk Hill was one of them. But she herself was almost forgotten. It was only because of a position she got in the last 2 years of her life she is remembered at all. This game is a simulation of the life of Alice, a historian, poet, advocates, politician, and leader. You can hit the milestones she hit (marked in blue), but the rest you can fill in and create one possibility of the life she lived.
