Time sweeps away the stories and lives of almost every person who walked this Earth. A few famous people have their stories still told such as Alexander the Great or Micheal Jackson. There are lots of people whose familes tell their stories to children and grandchildren, but in the grand scheme of things, most are forgotten. Some noble people take it up upon themselves to help preserve these stories. Alice Polk Hill was one of these instances. But she herself was almost forgotten. It was only because of a position she got in the last 2 years of her life she is remembered at all. 
This game is a simulation of the life of Alice, a historian, poet, advocates, politician, and leader. Most of this information is lost, but true facts will be marked in <span class="bold">bold</span> and the rest is information that has been made up to make a cohesive story. In this game you could live a life that Alice may have lived, but we will never know how right or wrong we were.
