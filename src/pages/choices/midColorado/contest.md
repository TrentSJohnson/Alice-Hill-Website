 <span class="bold">You end up teaming up with the Daughters of the Confederacy (you are from Kentucky and lived through the Civil War) to create a yearly essay contest with a prompt relating to the history of Colorado. To motivate students, there was a prize of $25* in gold. </span>

*$25 dollars in gold is now worth $756.90 and, if kept in gold, would be worth $1649.08
