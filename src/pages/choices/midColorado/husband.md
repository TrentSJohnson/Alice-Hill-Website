You and William have a delightful day together and realized that you don't have a marriage license in Colorado yet. <span class="bold">Thus, you guys go to the courthouse, get a new marriage certificate</span>, and have a lovely romantic meal together.

Hill, Polk Alice. <p class="italic">Colorado In History and Story.</p> Pierson & Gardner, 1884
