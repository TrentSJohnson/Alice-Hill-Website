You held this position for two years before passing away. This position is what made you live beyond you time on Earth. Being a state Poet Laureate is a position that ended up being well recorded and helped make you famous. Alice Polk Hill kept her legacy through her life time of work supporting women, history, and the arts. But despite all of her great triumphs, she is being lost to history. I hope that you will remember her, maybe google her or look her up on Wikipedia. Maybe research the poet laureate of your country, state, city, or even just the guys who reads poetry at Starbucks. These people have stories that should be remembered.

During this research initiative, I couldn't find her greatest poem "Colorado" or "Twilight" or "Lure of the Trail" or the play she wrote or the speeches she gave or documentation of the name of her child. Wikipedia provided different birth years depending on which part of the article you looked. This project for me highlighted how hard is it is to even remeber important people, artists, and leaders. Poetry is is art that is often forgotten about. Let's try to avoid that.
