I am not Ready Yet

Alice Polk Hill

In the nursery was burning a fire, warm and bright,<br/>
And the lamp from above threw a radiant light, <br/>
On a little boy's head with its soft curling locks, <br/>
He was busily building his houses of blocks. <br/>
There was joy in his heart and a smile in his eye.<br/> 
And unheeded the fast flying moments went by. . <br/>
"It is late," said his papa, "you must go to bed." <br/>
With a face full of sorrow he looked up and said: <br/>

â€œO, papa, I am not ready yet. "<br/>
See my house is not finished, O, please let me stay." <br/>
He again sadly pleaded when going away: <br/>
"O, papa I am not ready yet." <br/>

And thus often we see in the nursery of life.<br/> 
Busy man as intent upon pleasure or strife, <br/>
That he stops not to think as the years hurry by.<br/> 
There's a time here to live, and a time yet to die. <br/>
Building houses on earth, building castles in air, <br/>
'Tls but little he recks, there's a time, too, for prayer;<br/> 
But when called to the slumber which closes his days, <br/>
With his work all unfinished he earnestly prays, <br/>

"O, Father, I am not ready yet;<br/>
 For my soul I've neglected, I thought not of death." <br/>
And he sadly implores with his last fleeting breath: <br/>
O, Father, I am not ready yet." <br/>
