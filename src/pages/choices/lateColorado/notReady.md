I am not Ready Yet
Alice Polk Hill

In the nursery was burning a fire, warm and bright, 
And the lamp from above threw a radiant light, 
On a little boy's head with its soft curling locks, 
He was busily building his houses of blocks. 
There was joy in his heart and a smile in his eye. 
And unheeded the fast flying moments went by. . 
"It is late," said his papa, "you must go to bed." 
With a face full of sorrow he looked up and said: 

â€œO, papa, I am not ready yet. 
"See my house is not finished, O, please let me stay." 
He again sadly pleaded when going away: 
"O, papa I am not ready yet." 

And thus often we see in the nursery of life. 
Busy man as intent upon pleasure or strife, 
That he stops not to think as the years hurry by. 
There's a time here to live, and a time yet to die. 
Building houses on earth, building castles in air, 
'Tls but little he recks, there's a time, too, for prayer; 
But when called to the slumber which closes his days, 
With his work all unfinished he earnestly prays, 

"O, Father, I am not ready yet; 
For my soul I've neglected, I thought not of death." 
And he sadly implores with his last fleeting breath: 

O, Father, I am not ready yet."
