To Alice--My Namesake
Alice Polk Hill

Fair, joyous child, with wondrous eyes, 
The royal purple 'round thee lies, 
Love's scepter strong is in thy hand. 
Subjects are e'er at thy command. 

No arrow-word has pierced thy heart, 
No faithless friend caused tears to start, 
Thy senses have not felt the pain 
Of anxious waiting all in vain. 

Time fast or slow thy soul knows not. 
Thy smiles, thy tears are soon forgot. 
No heavy thoughts yet cloud thy eyes. 
Thy stream of life reflects the skies. 
 
Look at me now, in happy mood, 
Which seems to whisper, "All is good." 
Yes, "all is good;" truth early sown! 
'Twill light thy way when youth has flown. 

Dear, happy child, our queen thou art! 
Those rosy lips, with smile apart, 
I stoop to kiss; their touch is sweet 
To loving lips that with them meet. 

Queen mayâ€™st thou reign in future years, 
Love-crowned like Esther 'midst thy peers 
Conquer all foes within, without, 
Until "Well done !" the angels shout.
